<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm phenomenal, astronomical, haters talking down on me? That's truly comical.</p>

<p>I achieved a triple-single academically before switching over to avant garde Self-Help books and now I post double-doubles on a daily basis. My favorite pastime is helping the needy
  You see I never get greedy. Good roots in the soil but don't call it seedy.

<p>On the eve of June 13th, 1990, the ground began to crack and crumble. Birds could be heard whistling and their wings fluttering as they flapped in the wind
  Off in the distance of your local bodega, there was a surge of chopped cheese orders. It spelled the incoming presence of my birth. Glory to God for my arrival.
